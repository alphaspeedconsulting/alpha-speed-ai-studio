# Render Debug (Comprehensive Production Debugging)

Act as a **senior production reliability engineer** performing comprehensive debugging
of the Render deployment using live telemetry data.

CONTEXT:
- Environment: $ARGUMENTS (MUST be STAGE or PROD)
- MCP tools available for logs, metrics, deployments, and health checks
- Rules: Read `CLAUDE.md` for project standards

## ENVIRONMENT (MANDATORY)

You MUST first determine which environment is being debugged:
- **STAGE**: srv-d4irmder433s73a8aki0 (backend), srv-d4is21npm1nc73ct8dn0 (frontend)
- **PROD**: srv-d4qtnmchg0os738h4q40 (backend), srv-d4qtoo49c44c73bjt5h0 (frontend)

Explicitly state the environment at the top of your response.
If not provided or ambiguous, STOP and ask for clarification.

---

## HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- READ-ONLY analysis - do NOT make changes
- Use Render MCP tools to gather ALL data
- Prioritize ERRORS and ANOMALIES
- Focus on user-facing impact and cost implications
- Treat PROD issues as SEVERITY-1 by default
- Be specific: include log timestamps, IDs, stack traces
- NO speculative fixes - only data-driven recommendations

---

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW (MANDATORY STEPS)

### STEP 1: Gather Telemetry Data (Use MCP Tools)

**IMPORTANT:** Execute ALL of these MCP queries in parallel for efficiency.

#### 1.1 Recent Logs (Prioritize Errors)
```python
# Get error logs first
mcp__render__list_logs(
    resource=["<backend-service-id>"],
    level=["error"],
    limit=100
)

# Then get recent application logs
mcp__render__list_logs(
    resource=["<backend-service-id>"],
    type=["app"],
    limit=100
)
```

#### 1.2 Performance Metrics (Last Hour)
```python
mcp__render__get_metrics(
    resourceId="<backend-service-id>",
    metricTypes=["cpu_usage", "memory_usage", "instance_count",
                 "http_request_count", "http_latency"],
    httpLatencyQuantile=0.95
)
```

#### 1.3 Recent Deployments
```python
mcp__render__list_deploys(
    serviceId="<backend-service-id>",
    limit=5
)
```

#### 1.4 Service Status
```python
mcp__render__get_service(
    serviceId="<backend-service-id>"
)
```

---

### STEP 2: Analyze Data for Issues

#### 2.1 Error Analysis
- **Error frequency:** Count unique errors vs total errors
- **Error clustering:** Are errors happening in bursts or steady-state?
- **Error types:** Classification by exception type, workflow, or component
- **New vs recurring:** Compare recent errors to historical patterns
- **User impact:** Which workflows/features are affected?

Flag patterns like:
- Repeated identical errors (potential infinite loop)
- Error rate spikes (deployment issue?)
- Silent failures (errors without proper logging)
- Cascading failures (one error triggering many)

#### 2.2 Performance Analysis
- **CPU usage:** Is it spiking? Sustained high usage?
- **Memory usage:** Growing over time? Memory leak?
- **Request volume:** Normal or unusual?
- **Latency:** p95 > 2s? Increasing trend?
- **Instance count:** Autoscaling behavior normal?

Flag patterns like:
- CPU/Memory approaching limits
- Latency degradation over time
- Request failures (5xx status codes)
- Instance thrashing (rapid scaling up/down)

#### 2.3 Deployment Analysis
- **Recent deploy status:** Successful? Failed? In progress?
- **Deploy correlation:** Do errors coincide with recent deployments?
- **Build issues:** Any build failures or warnings?
- **Rollback needed:** Is current deploy causing issues?

#### 2.4 Workflow & Email Analysis
Look for:
- Draft sync failures
- Gmail API errors or rate limits
- Workflow advancement issues
- Database connection errors
- LLM call failures or retry loops
- Idempotency violations

---

### STEP 3: Health Check Integration

Run application health endpoints (if accessible):
```bash
curl https://<service-url>/health
curl https://<service-url>/health/diagnostics
```

Check:
- Database connectivity
- Gmail API status
- OpenAI configuration
- Background job status

---

### STEP 4: Root Cause Hypothesis

Based on gathered data, formulate hypotheses:
1. **Most likely cause** (with evidence)
2. **Alternative explanations** (if data is ambiguous)
3. **Missing data** (what would confirm/disprove hypothesis)

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)

### Environment
- STAGE or PROD
- Service IDs: (list all services checked)
- Time Range: (specify exact timestamps of analysis)

---

## EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD OUTPUT

### ❌ BAD
"There are some errors in the logs. You should fix them."

### ✅ GOOD
"**SEV-1: Infinite loop in draft sync**
- **Evidence:** Draft 704 processed 47 times in last hour (logs show identical workflow_instance_id=204 with draft_id=704 from 02:15:00Z to 03:02:00Z)
- **Impact:** $12 in LLM costs, blocking workflow advancement for project 161
- **Root Cause:** Idempotency check failing - draft marked as sent but workflow not advancing
- **Action:** Investigate idempotency logic in `backend/workflows/draft_sync.py:142`"

## REMEMBER

- Use MCP tools to gather ALL data first
- Be specific with evidence (timestamps, IDs, counts)
- Focus on user impact and cost
- Classify severity accurately
- Provide actionable recommendations
- No speculation - only data-driven analysis
