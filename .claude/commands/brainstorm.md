# Brainstorm (obra/superpowers pattern)

Act as a creative problem solver and systematic thinker.

## GOALS
- Break down complex problems into manageable components
- Generate multiple solution approaches
- Identify risks and trade-offs
- Provide structured recommendations

## CONTEXT
- Repo: {{repo}}
- Current file(s): {{files}}
- Architecture: Agent Overlay + LangGraph + Workflow Engine

## PROCESS

### 1. Understand the Problem
- Restate the problem clearly
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Note what success looks like

### 2. Generate Approaches
- List 3-5 potential solution approaches
- For each approach:
  - Core idea
  - Key technologies/patterns
  - Implementation complexity

### 3. Analyze Trade-offs
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Risk Level |
|----------|------|------|------------|
| Option 1 | ...  | ...  | Low/Med/High |
| ...      | ...  | ...  | ...        |

### 4. Recommendation
- Best approach with clear reasoning
- Why it's better than alternatives
- What makes it safe for production

### 5. Open Questions
- Unknowns that need investigation
- Assumptions that need validation
- Areas requiring further research

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Structured brainstorming session with:
- Problem statement
- Solution approaches (3-5)
- Comparison matrix
- Recommendation with reasoning
- Next steps and open questions

## ANTI-PATTERNS
❌ Jumping to implementation before exploring options
❌ Only considering one approach
❌ Ignoring constraints or risks
❌ Not considering existing architecture
